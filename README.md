# Auditing Large Language Models: Toolkits for Text-Based Stereotype Detection

This repository provides scripts for training stereotype classifiers on both multi-dimensional and single-dimensional levels, and at both sentence and token granularities.

## Quick Start
To train all classifiers, execute the following script:

```bash
bash Training-All.sh
```

## Detailed Instructions

### Sentence-Level Training

#### Multi-Dimensional Classifier
To train a multi-dimensional classifier at the sentence level, run:
```bash
bash MD-SL-Training.sh
```

#### Single-Dimensional Classifier
To train a single-dimensional classifier at the sentence level, run:
```bash
bash SD-SL-Training.sh
```

### Token-Level Training

#### Multi-Dimensional Classifier
To train a multi-dimensional classifier at the token level, run:
```bash
bash MD-TL-Training.sh
```

#### Single-Dimensional Classifier
To train a single-dimensional classifier at the token level, run:
```bash
bash SD-TL-Training.sh
```
```
